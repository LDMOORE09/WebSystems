        <p>This current Fall '22 semester is the first semester of my junior year. My classes for the semester are Intro. to Web Systems, Management of Info. Tech, Principles of Management, Professional Internship Seminar, and Software Design. The class that I'm most looking forward to is Professional Internship Seminar because it's bringing in recruiters for companies that are looking to hire students. Right now, I am looking for an IT job on campus to gain experience.</p>
